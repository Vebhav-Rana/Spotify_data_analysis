# Spotify_data_analysis
Basic data analysis of Spotify music data using python

## About this project
This project is about analyzing Spotify music data to understand some basic patterns like which artists appear the most and how popular tracks are overall.  
I made this project mainly to practice Python and Pandas on a real dataset and to get comfortable working with data.

## Dataset info
The dataset includes details such as:
- track name
- artist name
- popularity score of tracks

The popularity column helped in comparing and doing analysis between different artists and songs.

## Tools I used
- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  

## What I did here
- Cleaned and explored the dataset using Pandas  
- Found top artists based on number of tracks  
- Calculated average popularity of artists  
- Made basic visualizations to understand popularity distribution  

## What I learned
- How to work with real datasets which are not always clean  
- Better understanding of Pandas functions like groupby, filtering and aggregation  
- How simple graphs can make data easier to understand  

## Project status
Project is completed, but it can be improved more in future by adding better visualizations and deeper analysis.
